# Grill-Barcode-Scanner
A barcode scanner for Phillips Exeter Academy's "Grill" convenience stores using [Quagga.js](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/) and Firebase.

By opening the app through [grill-barcode.web.app](https://grill-barcode.web.app) or [grill-barcode.firebaseapp.com](https://grill-barcode.firebaseapp.com) you can scan the barcode of an item. Codes that have already been recorded in the database will return the name and price of the scanned item. For items that cannot be scanned (like Sprite bottles due to the color of their barcode), you can input the numbers below the barcode to manually search the code. Be sure to inclue the small numbers on the left and rightmost ends of the barcode as shown below.

The database is available for public use.
